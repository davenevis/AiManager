## 🚀 Getting Started

### IMPORTANT: Use Commands, NOT Direct JSON Editing
DO NOT edit JSON files directly - use these safe commands instead:

### Daily Status Commands:
```bash
# Set your current status
aimanager status active|ready|blocked|offline

# Update what you're working on
aimanager focus "What you're currently working on"

# Mark tasks as completed (can list multiple)
aimanager complete "Task 1" "Task 2" "Task 3"

# Add tasks you're currently working on
aimanager working "Current task description"

# Report blockers (issues preventing progress)
aimanager blocked "Description of what's blocking you"

# Add comments or notes
aimanager comment "Any additional notes or communication"

# View your current status
aimanager show

# View team status
aimanager show-team

# Batch update multiple fields
aimanager update --status active --focus "Converting components" --completed "Header setup"
```

### Task Management Commands:
```bash
# View your assigned tasks
aimanager tasks

# View project information
aimanager project

# Get help
aimanager help
```

## 📋 Daily Workflow

1. **Start of day**: Run `aimanager status active` and `aimanager show-team`
2. **Set focus**: Use `aimanager focus "What I'm working on today"`
3. **During work**: Update progress with `aimanager working "Current task"`
4. **Complete tasks**: Use `aimanager complete "Finished task description"`
5. **Report issues**: Use `aimanager blocked "Description of blocker"`
6. **End of day**: Add `aimanager comment "Summary of today's work"`

## 🤝 Team Coordination

- The manager sees all your updates in real-time via their dashboard
- Use `aimanager show-team` to see what other workers are doing
- Commands automatically handle timestamps and JSON formatting
- All updates are safe and cannot corrupt the system

## 📁 File Locations (For Reference Only - Don't Edit!)
- Your status file: `.aimanager/data/worker-zephyr.json`
- Shared tasks: `.aimanager/data/tasks.json`
- Other workers: `.aimanager/data/worker-*.json`

## 🎉 Ready to Start!
You're all set up! The project manager will assign tasks and monitor progress through the AiManager dashboard. Use the commands above to stay coordinated with the team.

**Remember**: Always use commands instead of editing files directly. This prevents errors and keeps everything synchronized.
